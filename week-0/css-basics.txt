CSS - lets you add styles, position things on page

Common styling attributes
    font-size : size of text
    border - line border (space betn the padding and margin)
    border-radius : the radius of the corner curve
    padding : the breathing space inside the div 
    margin : space outside the div - the space betn divs
    box-shadow : the shadow - it excepts 4 things - 3 values and 1 color (1st - direction in which the shadow gives)

Positioning
divs always take up all the space available horizontally
spans only take up as much space as needed

Can we make divs take up only the space needed? like how can you position them some space away on same horizontal?
    Yes. margins. and?
    float property - float to right/left
    but this is the dumb way. right way is flexbox.

    Flexbox : Positioning the children.
            'display:flex' on parent makes all its immediate children divs reside in the same line. (div siblings inside parent)
            and then there are diff attributes for the inside positioning
                justify-content

Ids are supposed to be unique. Used to uniquely identify a div/span/input/button
You can use a same class to multiple elements.
