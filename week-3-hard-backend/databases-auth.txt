The fetch API - fetch data from a backend.
                fetch() wasn't part of javascript. Its part of the runtime.
                we can set method like get, post... Default is GET.
                
Hashing - converting a simple string into some gibberish and same always.
          why? - safety.
          a single input will always give single output
          one-way: You cannot convert the hash back into the original string. 
          (so, hashing doesnt require a key/password)

Encryption - This is two-way(Provided you have a key). string <--> gibberish.
             (Note : imgs dont get stored and 2s. in dbs directly like jpg. Stored like 1s)
             But anyone with the key can decrypt the code.

Json Web Token - JSON: works with only json data,
                 Web: used on web 
                 Token: creates a token at the end.
                 Anyone who has the token can see the original contents.
whats a jwt? - some complex input object converted using a password into simple output object(by somehow compressing), anyone having that output can see the input.
why even do it? - there's something called verification that only the servers can do!
                  jwt.verify().
                  very similar to encryption + verification 

                  
What verification? - 2 functions of jwt: jwt.sign() - to create token
                                         jwt.verify(token, jwtPasswword) - to verify

[   Recap:
    Hashing: one-way. Given the output, no one can find out the input.
             Changing the input a lil bit changes the output by a lot

    Encryption: two-way.
                A string is encrypted using a password.
                String can be decrypted using the same password.

    JWT: Its neither of encryption nor hashing (its techically a digital signature)
         Anyone can see the original output given the signature.
         Signature can be verified only using the password.

Local Storage - A place in your browser where you can store some data. like a browser's storage.
                Usually things that are stored include - Authentication tokens,
                                                         User language preference
                                                         User theme preference

                Even if we restart the machine, the data remains there. So the frontend can relay back to this in every request.
                Stored almost forever. When deleted? - whenever we want.
Why here - frontend can send jwts(after receiving first) thru localstorage for our aunthentication at the backend.

Databases - why? - Real data is dynamic.
                   if we update inmemory objects, the updates are lost if the process restarts.
                   There are multiple servers.
Remember: user hits backend. Backend hits db. User cannot hit db directly.
There are multiple types of databses:
                                      Graph DBs,
                                      Vector DBs,
                                      SQL DBs,
                                      NoSQL DBs

MongoDB - NoSQL DB, schemaless. scales well and is a decent choice for most use cases.
     
How does the backend connect to the database? - Using libraries.

Mongoose - is mongodb library.
           first create connection using the URI string,
           tell what your schema lokks like,
           do queries.

There's also a mongoDB driver library. Mongooseis built on mongoDB with some extra functions and stuff (unsure?)

JWTs
    for verification at server.Dot.
    my jwt = just like my chequebook.
    They are issued by the backend when you signin.
    Anyone can create something very similar but the backend will reject it.
    If you loose the original jwt then there is a problem.
    
    There are 3 things: 1.generating a jwt
                            The function to generate is sign()
                                `jwt.sign(the value i want to encode, the passowrd i want to encode with)`
                            This secret is what the bank has and only the bank has
                            This token has been generated using this secret and hence this token can only be verified using this secret
    
                        2.decoding jwt
                            `jwt.decode()`   
                        3.verifying jwt
                            `jwt.verify()`
                            Remember: verify is something wierd. if verified, returns true but if wrong input, throws error.
JWT saves you a database call
["Anyone can decode the jwt but only the backend can verify."]
