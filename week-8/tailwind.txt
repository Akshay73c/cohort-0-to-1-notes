4 things to know in a frontend framework: 
    1. Flex - lets you position elements right next to each other.  
              if you want to keep things in same line 
              `display:flex, justify-content:xyz`
    2. Grids - ,
    3. Responsiveness,
    4. Background color, text color, hover 

Tailwind - a css framework
           Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for `class names`, 
           generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file. 

How do you make the divs take diff width based on window size? - Responsiveness
    Breakpoints - standard points/widths at which we chnage our layout
                  like sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl,...  

By default, tailwind uses a "mobile-first breakpoint sys".                  
    - UNDERSTAND: unprefixed utilities take effect on all screen sizes, while prefixed utilities only take effect ar the specified breakpoint and above.
