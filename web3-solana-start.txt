Blockchain - A chain of networks/computers/machines that secures the network itself for stuff. Main stuff - financing
             Network - contains addressing of a bitcoin address to how much bitcoin they own.
             Crux - Without any central authiurity, created a financing system
            
Ethereum - is a blockchain only + lets you deploy smart contracts on the bockchain.
           Language - Solidity - to write these smart contracts
           https://cryptozombies.io/ 

Contract - is like the basic fundamental part of ethereum.
           its juss like the class in java. Lets you store some data and have some methods associated with it and do stuff.
           And some specific things too obvio. like we can store eth in a contract
           Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts.
           So in solidity, mostly ,we're writing contracts and work with them.
           All solidity source code should start with a "version pragma" â€” a declaration of the version of the Solidity compiler this code should use
           Remember - State variables are permanently stored on the blockchain. 
           Structs - similar to class (same meaning as in java/c++)

["In web3, everything is stored on the blockchain/contracts only.(Backend+db all in contract)"]

There're 2 ways to pass an argument - by value 
                                      by reference
It's a convetion to start a fxn arg variable name with an underscore _
Solidity fxns are public by default.
