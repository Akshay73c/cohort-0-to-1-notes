DOM - Programming interface for web documents.
      represents the page as a tree of objs; each obj means a part of the page.

What was javascript? - an implementation of the ECMAScript. Nothing related to browser. Jussa programming lang
But JS that runs in browser has some extra fxns also.
Browser JS = JS scpecs + (setTimeout, fetch, setInterval, document)
                                                          
In HTML/CSS, Ids are used(supposed to) uniquely identify a div/span/input/button
But classes also do similar then whyy Ids?
     "Ids let us access elements via the DOM API!"
     so Ids originally were for CSS, but we mostly use it for Javascript. 

To make any website dynamic, you need javascript. More specifically the DOM API.

DOM lets us manipulate our html page using javascript.

document - global variable using which we can manipulate the DOM
           gives us reference to the html element - a dom object

fetch - lets us hit an API/backend
        [Note: fetch just returns a response. It also doesnt know its type.
              so we need to again call a async fxn like .json() or .text() as per our expectation.]
        Thats why we prefer axios. it directly gives us the data.      

Debouncing - you dont send out req immediately - delay in sending out the req
             to avoid multiple reqs going out
             why? - minimize 
             how ? - setTimeout, clearTimeout

Throttling - similar to debouncing but at the backend
             avoid muliple incoming reqs
