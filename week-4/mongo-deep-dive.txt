db - data is stored persistently - coz servers are scaled, are transient. 

why don't we let users hit db directly?
    1. dbs were/are written in diff protocols that browsers dont understand.
    2. dbs don't have granual access.(part wise access). Server can do this by auth checks.
    Although: there are dbs like firebase having granual access and let http/browsers talk to db directly!

Mongoose - library 
           Mongoose lets you define schema. But mongodb are schemaless?
           see, mongodb doesn't adhere to this schema, we can insert anything to it. Its just this mongoose library. 
           why? whats the benifit?- autocompletions. validating data before it goes in db.
                                    and coz devs are dumb and forget stuff.
Mongodb lets us add nested objects in the data. 
So, can create re lationships easily. by using 'type' and 'ref'.
ObjectId - randomly generated - unique way to identify a data.


model - final object on which we can do CRUD. like User.create()

Jargons in Databases: Cluster - like a collection of databases
                      Database - means collection
                      Table - means docs
