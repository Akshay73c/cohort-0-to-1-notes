Why react? - its hard to do DOM manipulations in convetional way
             react makes this easy. Under the hood its HTML/CSS/JS only

Jargons 
State - an object that represents the current state of the app
        its the dynamic things. Anything that changes.

Component - how a DOM element should render, given a state.
            re-usable, dynamic element that changes as per state.
            a fxn at its core that does this stuff. Returns us what is required.

Re-rendering - actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes

jsx - a js file, inside which you can write both JS and xml

index.html + main.jsx + App.jsx
How does this all reactc code get converted to html/css/js?
     npm run build  - creates  a dist folder which has just index.html and js stuff
                    we can host this. 

Whenever you have to write any js tuff in react code, wrap it in curly braces {}.
