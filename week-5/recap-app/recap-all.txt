Whenever you get a work, add a README file.
First build backend.

Backend - initiallize a node project
          most imp - put a package.json - what all packages and scripts, what all external dependecies you're using.
          ["You do not share node modules. Share only package.json. It has everything."]
          package-lock.json - with locked versions
          
dependecies - needed when you'll run your app          
devDependencies - needed when you're developing yout app

You cannot hit a backend url from a diff frontend url unless your backend allows tht frontend. Hence CORS.

fetch() doesn't by default tell your backend about json data.
We need to add a header like 
`
headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
`
Hence we use axios.
